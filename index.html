          <p>This page will help you install and build your first React Native app. If you already have React Native
            installed, you can skip ahead to the <a
              href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial">Tutorial</a>.</p>
          <p><b>If you are coming from a web background</b>, the easiest way to get started with React Native is with
            Expo tools because they allow you to start a project without installing and configuring Xcode or Android
            Studio. Expo CLI sets up a development environment on your local machine and you can begin writing a React
            Native app within minutes. For instant development, you can use <a href="https://snack.expo.io/">Snack</a>
            to try React Native out directly in
            your web browser.</p>
          <p><b>If you are familiar with native development</b>, you will likely want to use React Native CLI. It
            requires
            Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able
            to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an
            hour installing and configuring them.</p>

          <h3>Expo CLI Quickstart</h3>
          <p>Assuming that you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node 10+</a> installed, you can use npm to
            install the Expo CLI command line utility:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>npm install -g expo-cli</code>
          </pre>
          <p>Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
    expo init AwesomeProject

    cd AwesomeProject
    npm start # you can also use: expo start
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>This will start a development server for you.</p>

          <h3>Running your React Native application</h3>
          <p>Install the <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the
            same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal
            to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.</p>
          <h3>Modifying your app</h3>
          <p>Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it. Open <code>App.js</code> in your text editor
            of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.</p>
          <h3>That's it!</h3>
          <p>Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.</p>
          <img src="./assets/GettingStartedCongratulations.png"
            alt="congrats" class="img-responsive">

          <h3>Now what?</h3>
          <p>
            Expo also has docs you can reference if you have questions specific to the tool. You can also ask for help
            at Expo forums.
          </p>
          <p>
            These tools help you get started quickly, but before committing to building your app with Expo CLI, read
            about the limitations.
          </p>
          <p>If you have a problem with Expo, before creating a new issue, please see if there's an existing issue about
            it:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>in the <a href="https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/issues">Expo CLI issues</a> (for issues related to Expo
              CLI), or</li>
            <li>in the <a href="https://github.com/expo/expo/issues">Expo issues</a> (for issues about the Expo client
              or SDK).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you're curious to learn more about React Native, continue on to the <a
              href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial">Tutorial</a>.</p>
          <h3>Running your app on a simulator or virtual device</h3>
          <p>Expo CLI makes it really easy to run your React Native app on a physical device without setting up a
            development environment. If you want to run your app on the iOS Simulator or an Android Virtual Device,
            please refer to the instructions for "React Native CLI Quickstart" to learn how to install Xcode or set up
            your Android development environment.</p>
          <p>Once you've set these up, you can launch your app on an Android Virtual Device by running npm run android,
            or on the iOS Simulator by running npm run ios (macOS only).</p>
          <h3>Caveats</h3>
          <p>Because you don't build any native code when using Expo to create a project, it's not possible to include
            custom native modules beyond the React Native APIs and components that are available in the Expo client app.
          </p>
          <p>If you know that you'll eventually need to include your own native code, Expo is still a good way to get
            started. In that case you'll just need to "eject" eventually to create your own native builds. If you do
            eject, the "React Native CLI Quickstart" instructions will be required to continue working on your project.
          </p>
          <p>Expo CLI configures your project to use the most recent React Native version that is supported by the Expo
            client app. The Expo client app usually gains support for a given React Native version about a week after
            the React Native version is released as stable. You can check this document to find out what versions are
            supported.</p>
          <p>If you're integrating React Native into an existing project, you'll want to skip Expo CLI and go directly
            to setting up the native build environment. Select "React Native CLI Quickstart" above for instructions on
            configuring a native build environment for React Native.</p>

        <!-- SECTION LEARN AND BASICS -->
        <section id="learn_the_basics" class="main-section">
          <header>Learn The Basics</header>
          <p>React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So
            to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React
            concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some
            React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components. This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether
            you have React experience or not.</p>
          <p>Let's do this thing.</p>
          <h3>Hello World!</h3>
          <p>In accordance with the ancient traditions of our people, we must first build an app that does nothing
            except say "Hello, world!". Here it is:</p>
          <div data-snack-id="@idindrakusuma/courageous-candies" data-snack-platform="web" data-snack-preview="true"
            data-snack-theme="light"
            style="overflow:hidden;background:#fafafa;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.08);border-radius:4px;height:505px;width:100%">
          </div>
          <script async src="https://snack.expo.io/embed.js"></script>
          <p>If you are feeling curious, you can play around with sample code directly in the web simulators. You can
            also paste it into your <code>App.js</code> file to create a real app on your local machine.</p>

          <h3>What's going on here?</h3>
          <p>Some of the things in here might not look like JavaScript to you. Don't panic. This is the future.</p>
          <p>First of all, ES2015 (also known as ES6) is a set of improvements to JavaScript that is now part of the
            official standard, but not yet supported by all browsers, so often it isn't used yet in web development.
            React Native ships with ES2015 support, so you can use this stuff without worrying about compatibility.
            import, from, class, and extends in the example above are all ES2015 features. If you aren't familiar with
            ES2015, you can probably pick it up just by reading through sample code like this tutorial has. If you want,
            this page has a good overview of ES2015 features.</p>
          <p>The other unusual thing in this code example is
            <code>&lt;View&gt;&lt;Text&gt;Hello world!&lt;/Text&gt;&lt;/View&gt;</code>. This is JSX - a syntax for
            embedding XML within JavaScript. Many frameworks use a special templating language which lets you embed code
            inside markup language. In React, this is reversed. JSX lets you write your markup language inside code. It
            looks like HTML on the web, except instead of web things like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, you use React components. In this case, <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> is a built-in
            component that just displays some text and View is like the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or
            <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.</p>

          <h3>Components</h3>
          <p>So this code is defining <code>HelloWorldApp</code>, a new <code>Component</code>. When you're building a
            React Native app, you'll be making new components a lot. Anything you see on the screen is some sort of
            component. A component can be pretty simple - the only thing that's required is a <code>render</code>
            function which returns some JSX to render.</p>

          <h3>This app doesn't do very much</h3>
          <p>Good point. To make components do more interesting things, you need to <a href="#props">learn about
              Props</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="props" class="main-section">
          <header>Props</header>
          <p>Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These creation
            parameters are called <code>props</code>.</p>
          <p>For more resource about <code>props</code>, you can at <a
              href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props">Props at Official Docs</a></p>
        </section>
        <section id="state" class="main-section">
          <header>State</header>
          <p>There are two types of data that control a component: <code>props</code> and <code>state</code>. props are
            set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component. For data that is going to
            change, we have to use <code>state</code>.</p>
          <p>In general, you should initialize state in the constructor, and then call <code>setState</code> when you
            want to change it.</p>
          <p>In a real application, you probably won't be setting state with a timer. You might set state when you have
            new data from the server, or from user input. You can also use a state container like Redux or Mobx to
            control your data flow. In that case you would use <code>Redux</code> or <code>Mobx</code> to modify your
            state rather than calling <code>setState</code> directly.</p>
          <p>When setState is called, BlinkApp will re-render its Component. By calling setState within the Timer, the
            component will re-render every time the Timer ticks.</p>
          <p>State works the same way as it does in React, so for more details on handling state, you can look at the <a
              href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate">React.Component API</a> . At this point, you
            might be annoyed that most of our examples so far use boring default black text. To make things more
            beautiful, you will have to learn about Style.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="height_and_width" class="main-section">
          <header>Height and Width</header>
          <p>A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.</p>
          <h3>Fixed Dimensions</h3>
          <p>The simplest way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed width and height to style. All
            dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.</p>
          <h3>Flex Dimensions</h3>
          <p>Use flex in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available
            space. Normally you will use flex: 1, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly
            amongst other components with the same parent. The larger the flex given, the higher the ratio of space a
            component will take compared to its siblings.</p>

          <p>If you just read through this website, you should be able to build a pretty cool React Native app. But
            React Native isn't just a product made by one company - it's a community of thousands of developers. So if
            you're interested in React Native, here's some related stuff you might want to check out.</p>
          <h3>Popular Libraries</h3>
          <p>If you're using React Native, you probably already know about React. So I feel a bit silly mentioning this.
            But if you haven't, check out React - it's the best way to build a modern website.</p>
          <p>One common question is how to handle the "state" of your React Native application. The most popular library
            for this is Redux. Don't be afraid of how often Redux uses the word "reducer" - it's a pretty simple
            library, and there's also a nice series of videos explaining it.</p>
          <p>If you're looking for a library that does a specific thing, check out <a
              href="http://www.awesome-react-native.com/">Awesome React Native</a>, a curated list of components that
            also has demos, articles, and other stuff.</p>
          <h3>Extending React Native</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fellow developers write and publish React Native modules to npm and open source them on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Making modules helps grow the React Native ecosystem and community. We recommend writing modules for
              your use cases and sharing them on npm.</li>
            <li>Read the guides on Native Modules (iOS, Android) and Native UI Components (iOS, Android) if you are
              interested in extending native functionality.</li>
            <li>Looking for a pre-built component? Check JS.coach or Native Directory to find what the community has
              been creating.</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>Development Tools</h3>
          <p><a href="https://nuclide.io/">Nuclide</a> is the IDE that Facebook uses internally for JavaScript development. The killer feature of Nuclide
            is its debugging ability. It also has great inline Flow support. VS Code is another IDE that is popular with
            JavaScript developers.</p>
            <p>For more information about resources and anything else about react native, please check the official documentation at <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/more-resources">React Native Official Docs</a></p>
